components used in fire alarm:

power supply:

It is used give power supply to circuit

ATMEGA328:

It is used to control the all circuit and send commands and operate buzzer

BUZZER:

Buzzer is used to make sound and it a output to the circuit

Gas sensor:

The MQ-2 module contains the MQ-2 gas sensor, some chip that performs signal conditioning, 
resistors, potentiometer for adjusting the sensitivity. 
The MQ-2 gas sensor itself contains gas sensitive conductive Tin Dioxide (SnO2) layer whose conductivity increases,
 that is, resistivity decreases when the gas concentration near it increases. 
This increase in conductivity or decrease in resistivity is translated into output voltage via the voltage divider that is formed by
 the internal SnO2 and the potentiometer and some resistors and capacitors 10KΩ resistor, 10KΩ resistor, 22uF capacitor.
